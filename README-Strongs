Converts the Strongs dictionary XML files found in the Open Scriptures strongs
repository [0] to a sqlite database.

Requirements:
- Python v2.6 or later

Notes:
- Various fields may contain leading or trailing whitespace and carriage
  returns.
- Some strongsref tags in the Greek XML make reference to Strongs numbers which
  are not included in the XML file. In those cases the strongs number is listed
  in place of the unicode for the reference lemma (e.g. "G5689").
- Hebrew when viewed in the console will appear LTR, but in text files and
  other uses should appear RTL.
- Some Greek entries have info outside of the three "note" types (e.g.
  derivation, definition, translation). These have been put in the "description"
  field.
