sblgnt-nltk.py downloads the plain text archive of the SBLGNT [0] and
normalizes it for use as Natural Language Tool Kit [1] corpus.

load-sblgnt.py takes the resulting output from above and loads it into an NLTK
Text object, and runs the collocations() and generate() functions as an 
example.

Requirements:
These scripts require NLTK 2.0 or higher (with its attendant requirements).
To quickly install the requirements with pip:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Use:
To run the script:

    $ python sblgnt-nltk.org

This will download and extract the archive, normalizing the text for an NLTK
corpus. Namely, this script 1) removes the leading verse number and tab
character from each verse, 2) removes trailing whitespace, 3) normalizes the
unicode characters, 4) removes text-critical signs, 5) adds back a newline in 
between verses, and 6) places the results in a text file. The resultant files 
will be placed in a new folder named 'out/' in the working directory.

Use with NLTK:
Then you can use these files to load them into an NLTK plain text corpus.
For example, the following Python shell commands:

    >>> import nltk
    >>> sblgnt = nltk.corpus.PlaintextCorpusReader('out','.*',encoding='utf-8')
    >>> sblgnt_text = nltk.text.Text([w.encode('utf-8') for w in sblgnt.words()

sblgnt will be an NLTK corpus object, and sblgnt_text will be an NLTK text
object. Refer to the NLTK documentation for uses of these classes.
