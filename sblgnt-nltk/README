sblgnt-corpus.py creates a tagged NLTK corpus from the MorphGNT [0]
files.  It uses the py-sblgnt module for source data and will output
the files in "morphgnt-corpus/". These files can then be loaded as a
tagged, categorized corpus using something like the following:

>>> import koine, nltk
>>> sblgnt = nltk.corpus.reader.CategorizedTaggedCorpusReader('sblgnt-corpus/'
    ,'.*',encoding=u'utf8',tag_mapping_function=koine.simplify_tag,
    cat_file='cats.txt')

Requirements: These scripts require Python 3, NLTK 3.0, and py-sblgnt.
To quickly install the requirements with pip:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
