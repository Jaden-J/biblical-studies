sblgnt-corpus.py creates a tagged NLTK corpus from the MorphGNT [0] files. 
It expects them to be located at local path "source/" and will output the 
files in "morphgnt-corpus/". These files can then be loaded as a tagged, 
categorized corpus using something like the following:

>>> import koine, nltk
>>> sblgnt = nltk.corpus.reader.CategorizedTaggedCorpusReader('sblgnt-corpus/'
    ,'.*',encoding=u'utf8',tag_mapping_function=koine.simplify_tag,
    cat_file='cats.txt')

Requirements:
These scripts require NLTK 2.0 or higher (with its attendant requirements).
To quickly install the requirements with pip:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
