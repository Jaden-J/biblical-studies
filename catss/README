lxxm-convert.py downloads a copy of the CATSS LXXM text and converts it to
unicode.

This script requires >= Python 2.6. It relies on argparse, which was included
with 2.7, so if you are using 2.6, you'll need to install it:

  $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Example usage:

  $ python lxxm-convert.py all

This completes all stages of the script. Output will be found in 'out/' and the
original source files will be found in 'source/'.

Individual stages (download, patch, convert, rename) can be invoked as well.
Run the script with the --help parameter for details.
